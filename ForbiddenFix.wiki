== Fixing Forbidden error in  apache server ==
If you configure apache2 server on ubuntu for custom directory. Let's say <i>/home/user/my-site</i>.<br/>
You highly likely get Forbidden error during accessing to your localhost. <br/>
To fix this situation add following script to your <i>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</i>
{{{
<Directory /home/user/my-site>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Require all granted
</Directory>
}}}
for version = 2.4

{{{
 Order allow,deny
Allow from all
}}}

for version = 2.2
