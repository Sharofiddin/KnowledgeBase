== Legacy keyring (trusted.gpg) warning removal ==
After upgrading system to Ubuntu 22.04 we can get warning when run <i> sudo apt update </i>.<br/>
It says that we are storing our keys deprecatd trusted.gpg. </br>
In such case, re-download this key, or extract it and save it in the 
{{{
  /usr/share/keyrings
	}}} 
	location by this command:
{{{
sudo curl https://www.pgadmin.org/static/packages_pgadmin_org.pub | sudo gpg --dearmour -o /usr/share/keyrings/pgadmin4.gpg
}}}	

In this example shown how to save key for pgadmin4, you can customize it for other keys.</br>
After this change your apt source list, so , it should be like this for  pgadmin4:
{{{
deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/pgadmin4.gpg] https://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/pgadmin/pgadmin4/apt/jammy pgadmin4 main
}}}

After this run 
{{{
sudo apt update
}}}
