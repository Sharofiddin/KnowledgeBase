== JDBC getting generated keys ==
If you use just
	{{{
		ResultSet#getGeneratedKeys
	}}}
	to get generated keys by insert or update (like autoincrement ids) some jdbc drivers won't return anything (like postgresql JDBC driver).</br>
	Just add 
	{{{
	RETURNING <key>
	}}}
	at the end of your query and situation will be fixed In shaa Allah.
